Using Sumatra (*) to Automate the Management of Simulations
===========================================================

Andrew Davidson (original developer) and Daniel Wheeler (speaker)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Sumatra is a lightweight system for recording the history and
provenance data for numerical simulations. It works particularly well
for scientists that are in the intermediate stage between developing a
code base and using the code base for active research. This is a
common scenario and often results in a mode of development that mixes
branching for both code development and production simulations.  Using
Sumatra avoids this unintended use of the versioning system by
providing a lightweight design for recording the provenance data
independently from the versioning system used for the code
development. The lightweight design of Sumatra fits well with existing
ad-hoc patterns of simulation management contrasting with more
pervasive workflow tools, which can require a wholesale alteration of
work patterns. Sumatra uses a straightforward Django-based data model
enabling persistent data storage independently from the Sumatra
installation.

Sumatra is both a command line utilty and a rudimentary web interface
that has the potential to be really cool. More stuff about Sumatra...

..
The speaker will demonstrate a number of typical usage
patterns for Sumatra and discuss achievable future goals.
