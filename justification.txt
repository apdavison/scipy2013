Justification for SciPy 2013
============================

The SciPy meeting is the main public forum for the scientific Python
community. In the last decade Python has become the preeminent
language for driving and managing scientific workflow with nearly
every major scientific group using Python to drive all aspects of
scientific management including development, workflow, and data
management. The benefits of the SciPy meeting can be justified by our
past attendance which has dramatically influenced our direction when
developing tools such as FiPy and enabling us to place Python workflow
and data management tools at the heart of the MGI initiative.

Daniel Wheeler will be presenting a talk entitled, "Using Sumatra to
automate the management of simulations". My goal is to disseminate the
idea of automated, simulation-centered workflow using the Python-based
Sumatra (*) tool. I will present this in the context of the MGI
initiate and discuss data-centered versus simulation-centered workflow
management. The talk will likely result in feedback from an audience
that will include many of the leaders in reproducible science and
workflow management as well as many developers of workflow tools.
