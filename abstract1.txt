Using Sumatra to Automate the Management of Simulations
=======================================================

Andrew Davidson and Daniel Wheeler
----------------------------------

Sumatra is a lightweight system for logging the provenance data for
numerical simulations. It works particularly well for scientist that
both develop with versioning systems whilst also executing multiple
simulations. This is a common work pattern and often results in a mode
of work that mixes branching for both code development and simulation
management. Sumatra overcomes this issue by providing a light weight
system for recorrding the provenance data independently from the
versioing system used for the code development. The lightweigth design
of Sumatra enables it to fit well with an exising ad-hoc pattern of
simulation management. It also uses a straightforward Django-based
data model enabling data queries even without a Sumatra installation.
